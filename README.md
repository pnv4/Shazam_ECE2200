# Shazam_ECE2200
This is final project in ECE 2200 course.
Part 1 includes 5 separate MATLAB files:
  • make_table.m extracts peaks and creates a table from a song in the database.
  • make_database.m uses make_table.m to create an efficient hash table for all the songs in the
  database. It also creates a table of song names.
  • hash.m combines the parameters from make_table.m into a unique feature that can be used to
  differentiate between songs.
  • matching.m compares two hash tables of the clip and the database.
  • main.m takes an input clip and identifies it.
Part 1 due Dec 2nd 5PM on BlackBoard.
